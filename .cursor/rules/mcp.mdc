- Whenever the user instructs to use MCP tools, always prioritize MCP servers and their tools for relevant tasks.
- Use MCP tools for debugging, troubleshooting, code generation, and any workflow where MCP is applicable.
- If multiple MCP tools are available, select the most relevant one based on the task.
- Confirm with the user if a tool requires manual server start (e.g., Browser Tools MCP).
- Never bypass MCP tools when the user explicitly requests their use.
